Communication is always easy as we speak several languages
Fronk is crazy about Brazil, where he lived for 2 years
Lieve adores India and Aurora is mad about Greece.
We have a preference for natural, vegetarian food.
Lieve and Fronk  practice Yoga daily..
We and our neighbours live on pleasant terms with each other.
Tranquility is a must in our home and in the building.
Please ring our bell... N°116/14 (fifth floor)

FLANDERS TODAY a flemish online newspaper has published an article about us and about Airbnb:
“In the last year we’ve had 60 or so guests staying with us at home,” says Fronk, who, with his partner Lieve, is one of the best-rated Flemish hosts on Airbnb, a hotel-like service for the digital age. “We have had guests from Brazil, the US, Canada, Iran, Japan, Bulgaria and more. Though no one from Africa has yet requested to stay.” 
Airbnb is an online marketplace for temporary accommodation across 33,000 cities in 192 countries. Trip planners can find spare rooms, flats, sofa-beds and even igloos and private islands. Some hosts are simply renting out a spare room for a couple of weeks a month to travellers to supplement their incomes or to fill the house when they themselves are away. 
Airbnb is in the vanguard of the so-called “sharing economy”, in which web services help private individuals monetise their possessions and share anything from school runs to electric drills. Flanders has more than 900 listings on the site. 
Connections 
Fronk and Lieve say that their guests have loved Antwerp and always have a good time. Yet if a number of their guests are visiting for tourism, many are in town for less conventional reasons. One was interviewing for a job at the opera house. Another was doing a course with world-famous contemporary artist Jan Fabre, while a third was studying with a leading dancer. A medievalist stayed for several weeks to learn Dutch for her research, while a Canadian rock band crashed when gigging down the road. 
Connecting with new people with different world views is one of the attractions, as is discovering a unexpected shared interest. “The other day I was having a bowl of soup with one of our guests, who had just arrived from the United States,” recalls Fronk. “To our surprise, we soon discovered that we were both working on essays on the same subject.” Fronk, who is a literary translator of Russian and a performer, and Lieve, an organist and soprano, say that in their year of hosting they have yet to have a bad experience. Some guests stay several weeks, some come back for a second or third visit. “But we make it clear on the website that we are vegetarians, that we do yoga and that this is a family house,” Fronk explains. This attracts people who are into the same things (and probably discourages those who want to spend their time exploring Antwerp’s party scene). 
Peer reviews 
Fronk and Lieve live in Borgerhout, a neighbourhood with a large immigrant population just east of the city’s Central Station, which is visible from their balcony. Borgerhout itself does not house many attractions and enjoys a reputation for being a rough sort of place. But guests have never had any problems, says Fronk. Indeed, he wistfully recalls a middle-aged American visitor looking out of the window at the district where Fronk grew up and declaring it a beautiful place. 
Importantly for guests, the area provides easy access by foot or bike to Antwerp’s main sites, including the zoo; elephants can be heard vaguely trumpeting from the flat’s balcony.

Aangezien ik meestal de organisator ben als we met vrienden op citytrip gaan, ben ik eveneens graag een goede host voor mijn gasten.
Daarom sta ik altijd klaar met suggesties om jullie verblijf extra aangenaam te maken.
Ik woon al meer dan 10 jaar in dezelfde buurt als het appartement, wat betekent dat ik snel in de buurt ben in geval van een probleempje, maar ook dat ik de buurt heel goed ken en voldoende tips kan geven wat betreft bezienswaardigheden en restaurantjes. 
Het appartement is ruim en heeft een grote woonkamer met hoog plafond, wat ervoor zorgt dat het gezellig vertoeven is als je met een groep vrienden of met het gezin een weekend samen wilt doorbrengen.
Het interieur is nogal eclectisch qua stijl, vintage gemixt met design klassiekers. Vooral geen zwart/wit, maar kleurrijk, en ook zo ingericht dat het lijkt alsof iemand er echt woont, geen steriele hotelkamer. Ik ben een liefhebber van films, fotografie en kunst, en dit valt eveneens als je het appartement betreedt. Litho's van Karel Appel en Dali worden afgewisseld met foto's van Helmut Newton en Herb Ritts. 
Als ik zelf op citytrip ga, vind ik naast de huiselijkheid van het appartement dat ik huur, de locatie erg belangrijk. Daarom dat ik voor het appartement op Vleminckveld gekozen heb, het ligt recht in het midden van alle belangrijke attracties/buurten.
Je kunt deze allemaal te voet bezoeken, het bruisende Zuid, het historisch centrum, het shopping gedeeltje,... 
Het ligt dus enorm centraal en terrasjes en restaurantjes liggen zeer nabij, maar toch is de straat erg rustig, dus van nachtlawaai is geen sprake. 
Niet te vergeten is de supermarkt die zich in hetzelfde gebouw bevindt, super handig als je last minute nog iets nodig hebt.
Kortom ik heb geprobeerd alle elementen waar ikzelf belang aan hecht als ik op citytrip ga, te bundelen in het appartement dat ik verhuur in mijn thuishaven Antwerpen.

Since I travel a lot for work and private purposes, my appartment is empty quiet a lot and so i like others to enjoy it too! Also I just love to take good care of people, so whenever you come at my place I will always try to put in this little extra thing to make you smile!

As a lot of people I started renting out my place to have an extra income, to cover for my bills and to create some financial space to travel more myself. Recently I started sharing my profit with charity because I wanted it to be something more, for me. So now 5% of the profit I make renting out my appartment is donated to charity. 'SOS Kinderdorpen' at the moment, I will add more later on.

Ik ben Debora.
Het appartement uit 1956 vonden we in geheel authentieke staat en we restaureerden zo getrouw mogelijk;

Doorgaans dient het als werkplek en showroom voor Debora, die mode-ontwerpers vertegenwoordigt. 
Door zijn unieke ligging is het intussen ook onze uitvalsbasis voor vakantieweekendjes in Antwerpen.

Tussen de modeseizoenen stellen wij het graag ter beschikking. De rust van de buren respecteren we graag.

I love the lively atmosphere of every city and try to enjoy it as much as possible. Going from concerts at festivals or parks, fashion and shopping, theatre performances, museums or just strolling through the city. And since I'm very social and quick to make contacts, the vision of an AirBnB is right up my alley. Providing a cosy space for wanderlust travelers, handing information about my town and creating some interaction without obtrusiveness. So travelling  in an unconventional way and interacting with locals is something the guests and I have in common. After travelling to San Francisco to live with a childhood friend, participating on an intercultural project in Mexico, sharing the apartment of an inhabitant in Berlin, Valladolid, Barcelona, Vienna, etc I even try to make a holiday out of being at home. Or as one of my favorite Dutch writers, Godfriend Bomans,  would put it; ""The art of living is to be at home when one is travelling"". I hope to bring my guests a feeling of ""Home"" during their stay and hopefully soon I'll meet and welcome you in Antwerp, I'm looking forward to it.

Ik ben  29 jaar, werk parttime en studeer  taal- en letterkunde aan de Universiteit van Antwerpen. Ik hou erg  van het levendige en bruisende, dat elke stad in zich heeft en probeer daar zoveel mogelijk van te genieten:  de terrasjes, optredens in parken of festivals, shoppen,   theatervoorstellingen, musea, flaneren door de stad, noem maar op.  Vermits ik vrij sociaal ben en snel  contacten maak, past de AirBnB -formule  helemaal in mijn visie: een cosy plek verschaffen aan de reislustige gasten, hen informatie geven over mijn stad en enige interactie opbouwen zonder opdringerigheid. Eén punt hebben de gasten en ik gemeen: we reizen graag, doen dit graag op een niet al te conventionele manier en houden van interactie met de plaatselijke inwoner(s).  Zo ging ik naar San Francisco om bij een jeugdvriendin in te wonen, nam deel aan een intercultureel project in Mexico,  deelde het appartement van een inwoonster in  Berlijn, Valladolid, Barcelona en Wenen, enz.  Ik probeer me ook thuis op reis te voelen of zoals de Nederlandse schrijver Godfried Bomans, één mijn favoriete schrijvers, het stelde : ” De kunst van te leven is thuis te zijn alsof men op reis is "". Ik hoop dat ik mijn gasten een gevoel van 'thuis zijn'  tijdens hun reis kan geven en hoop jullie snel te mogen verwelkomen en ontmoeten in (Website hidden by Airbnb) kijk er alvast naar uit..

Tengo 29 años y estudio Lengua y Literatura en la Universidad de Amberes y trabajo a medio tiempo en la ciudad. Me encanta el ambiente animado de cada ciudad y trato de disfrutarlo lo más posible con paseos a conciertos en festivales o parques, a través de la moda y las compras, obras de teatro, museos o simplemente pasear por la ciudad. Como soy una persona muy social y que rápidamente hace contactos, la visión de Airbnb es lo mío. Ofrezco un espacio agradable para los viajeros con deseo de explorar, facilito información sobre mi ciudad y establezco algún tipo de interacción sin impertinencia. Viajar de una manera poco convencional e interactuar con la gente local, es algo que los clientes y yo tenemos en común. Después de haber viajado a la ciudad de San Francisco para vivir con una amiga de la infancia, participado en un proyecto intercultural en México, compartido el apartamento de un habitante de Berlín, Valladolid, Barcelona, Viena, y más lugar, hasta trato de hacer unas vacaciones estando en mi casa. Como dice uno de mis escritores Neerlandés favoritos, Godfried Bomans ""el arte de vivir es estar en casa cuando uno está viajando."" Espero darles a mis invitados una sensación de ""hogar"" durante su estancia y espero que pronto pueda darle la bienvenida en Amberes.

我今年 29歲，在UA修語言及文學，同時在安特衛普打工。我喜歡每一個城市的熱鬧氛圍，不管是音樂節，公園演唱會，時尚購物，戲劇表演，博物館，或在市中心散步，我都盡可能找機會品嘗。另外我很樂於交朋友，不管是提供舒適的空間給旅遊愛好者，傳達關於我的城市的資訊，或無壓力的互動，我很理解也能夠發揮Airbnb想表達的精神，畢竟非凡的旅遊方式和與當地人交集是我們的共同點。

My name is Thomas and I'm born and raised in Antwerp. I like cooking, cycling and skiing. I've recently rebuild this apartment and now I finally live here. 
Besides that, there is no secret place in Antwerp if we talk about restaurants, nice bars and fun spots to go out. I even have a list of restaurants per category which I'm happy to share with you when you stay in Antwerp
For work, I travel a lot to Amsterdam, Berlin and Copenhagen so always up for a drink there.

Daarvoor heb ik in Nederland, Engeland en Duitsland gewoond en gewerkt. Ik hou van reizen en ben ondertussen al op veel plekken geweest. Reizen met een gezin is wel wat anders dan alleen en mede daardoor ben ik op het idee gekomen om een familie-vriendelijke vakantiewoning te gaan verhuren. 

Toen onze kinderen nog een stuk kleiner waren vond ik het lastig om leuke adressen te vinden die voorzien waren van een aantal dingen die je als jonge ouders nodig hebt (en waarvan je geen zin hebt ze altijd mee te zeulen...). 

Ondertussen woon ik lang genoeg in Antwerpen om hier een heleboel leuke plekken te kennen die ik graag deel met gasten. Zowel voor mensen op zakenreis, families met kinderen, stellen of vriendengroepen zijn er veel leuke dingen te doen en te ontdekken. Ik stel mijn stad graag aan je voor!"

I've landed in Antwerp in 2015. Over five years already. I LOVE this city. It's gentle and creative, it's got great museums and the best coffeebars. I will leave you a list of recommendations. 

But above all, living in a place like The Beguinage (Het Begijnhof) is the best blessing ever. City center AND quiet. It's a beautiful medieval place with a sacred garden where old trees speek to you - if you listen very carefully...

I hope to see you soon and welcome you here in my mystic abode.

The house is very cosy and colorful and I hope you'll feel at home. It's decorated with really exotic details. It has three floors. On the first floor you have a huge living room with a hammock and a giant kitchen which is especially designed as I am a professional cook. On the second floor you have the shared large bathroom with a separate shower and a big bathtub. The rooms for rent are on the third floor. They are not too big but with every comfort you will need like a good quality bed, matras and enough drawers. The kitchen, living room and the bathroom are shared.

It's not a house with a lot of  house rules; but we expect our guest to have awareness of some fundamentals like; respect, hygiene and open communication. 

The location of the house is ten minutes walk from Antwerpen Berchem station and five minutes walk from tram and bus stops. You have also a really nice square in five minutes walking distance  ""Dageraadsplaats"" with a lot of cafes bars and restaurants. 
There is a supermarket 50 meters from the house, open all days. There is also a very large supermarket about 300 meters from the house.

Antwerp is a city rich in history, multilingual and very lively. We have been living here in the historic center for 5 years now. It is with great enthusiasm that we start our own Airbnb in order to share some of our discoveries (activity, restaurant, bar, culture, ...) with you.

Zo genieten we ervan om de fijne ervaring die we zelf hebben met het verblijf in ons appartement te delen met anderen die de stad Antwerpen willen verkennen of gewoon een heerlijk weekendje met vrienden door willen brengen.
We vinden het belangrijk om vanuit vertrouwen en respect om te gaan met andermans eigendom, maar ook zorg te dragen voor de wereld om ons heen. 
Sfeer en eigenheid is voor ons onmisbaar.. Dat maakt de plek waar je verblijft..

Daarnaast zijn we graag bezig met het creëren van nieuwe dingen; meubels maken, fotograferen, beeldend werken.

Stad en platteland is voor ons een belangrijke afwisseling, zowel om te wonen als om te reizen. "

I made a career switch recently going from management consultant to small enterpreneur, which gives me more time to focus on my interests and hobbies such as interior design, art, music (I play piano !) and travel.

Hi everyone,
My name is Christel and this is my story:
I come from the countryside of Belgium. You know...like a small time-stood-still-village where everybody knows everybody :) ? Well, the only way to get out of there once in a while is by going to my favorite city in Belgium, Antwerp.

The City.
I like art, no I mean I LOVE art. Music, theatre, ballet, expositions, literature, performances,...are my sources of inspiration to be creative. I also love  Antwerp is both modern and authentic. It’s a city that moves. There are dozens of cultural activities every week. The food in the restaurants, even in the tiny bars are amazing. It’s ALL about exploring with all your senses. 

About the apartment.
My husband, my kids and I renovated this building a couple of years ago. I prefer to stay there once in a while, having some time for myself. That’s why we decided it to rent it on Airbnb. We’ve chosen for this neighborhood ‘cause it’s the most upcoming place in Antwerp. It’s on a foot walk from the centre and yet it’s different. It’s Antwerps most multicultural neigbourhood. Over 70 different nationalities! And they all have their own cultural traditions which are awesome to discover!

To my guests.

I am Frà, short for Francesca, an Italian but I moved to Belgium 10 years ago to be with Dominique, my Flemish husband, with whom I have two little girls. We are an eclectic couple, joined by many small aspects that make our cultural diversity very interesting.
I like to cook, sports and I enjoy my social life. I love the sea and the sun.
I think Antwerp is a funny and interesting city, where you can really find anything what you like on every single moment. 

 “La casa di frà” è nata dal desiderio di conoscere persone che viaggiano alla scoperta di luoghi e di culture diverse. 
Sono Frà, abbreviazione di Francesca, un’italiana che vive in Belgio da 10 anni e sposata con un fiammingo, Dominique, e abbiamo due bambine. Siamo una coppia eclettica,  le nostre diversita' culturali rendono affascinante e interessante la nostra vita. 
Mi piace cucinare, fare sport e chiacchierare con gli amici e conoscerne di nuovi. Amo il mare e il sole.
Trovo Anversa una città divertente e stimolante, tutta da scoprire.

Bijkomend werk ik ook als Freelancer in het bedrijf van mijn partner. Leuk weetjes over mij: ik houd van 1 perfect kopje koffie per dag en overal waar ik naar toe ga neem ik mijn loopschoenen mee.

I have always loved adventures, meeting new people go to unknown places,... I'm lucky that my partner shares this passion with me and recently we can share this with our kids. My international orientation is also included in my job as Program Manager for an international management school where I every year meet new people coming from around the world.

Starting from my own travel experiences and the encounter with so many people with various cultural backgrounds made me of course very skilled for the hosting of guests from all over the world.

We are expats (a Canadian and a Belgian) who spent almost two decades living and working abroad.   Our favourite country was Namibia where we enjoyed 8 fabulous years, followed closely by Brooklyn, New York, and now we're retired in Malta (which we love!).  We are so fortunate and grateful for the many amazing adventures we've enjoyed and for all of the wonderful and loving friends we've made all over the world.  

If you want more information about us, you can check out the book I wrote in Namibia as a fund-raiser for a charity I support, just to prove to you I'm authentic.   Search for Danette Jaeb - Walk a Mile in My Shoes.  I also have a website that you can find if you search for me.

We are trying our hands at hosting our apartments if and when they are available.  Bear with us as we learn how to become Airbnb hosts.   We don't have many ratings yet since we have friends often staying at our studio but have decided to take a more serious stab at this now (September 2021).  

Thank you all.

We proudly offer accommodation for 3 different group sizes, 4 14 or 18 people, thus be it a couple on their honeymoon or romantic city break, or even a larger group getting together for a fun weekend or conference, we will be delighted to accommodate.

We also proudly offer a dining/conference hall in the building (multi option lighting, set according to your venue and needs).

Ja ik ben dus al wat wijzer maar niet grijzer!  
Ik geniet als er mensen rond me zijn, maar houd ook er van rust en stilte.

Living without being able to garden would not work for me. Growing my own vegetables, herbs and fruits is my healthy addiction. Cooking these fruit and veg another. When the Belgian weather doesn’t make a gardener happy and I have to stick indoors, you will find me reading endlessly. Mainly historical fiction novels, which I tend to spice with some scientific non-fiction.
I love to swim and run….and scan second-hand shops and flee markets. When I discover something lying in the streets or materials my neighbors or friend true out, I will confiscate them to turn them into something “NEW”. Maybe you can discover some of these lovely treasures when you visit my place.
I am looking forward meeting you.

I love this city and enjoy living in the close proximity to all kinds of nice cafe's, restaurants, theathers, summer bars, stores, etc! In my free time, I like cooking, reading, watching films, spending time with friends, exploring new spots in and outside Antwerp. For sure you can count on me to get good advice on where to eat or go to, from fine dining to the most child-friendly places. I live almost next door to the apartment, together with my husband and two young children. After working for 15 years in a multinational company, mainly as Customer Service Manager, I have decided in 2017 to have some time off to spend with my family and follow my passions, and possibly make an own business out of it in the future. This also gave me the extra time to be able rent this apartment to guests, so that they can enjoy the space and this wonderful city. The apartment was originally meant for our family and friends visiting us from abroad, but we thought it will be a pity not to share it with others when it is not occupied. Hope you will like and cherish it as much as we do.  And hope to meet you soon!"

De microbe voor reizen en toerisme was aangewakkerd. 

In de middelbare school en op de Hogeschool ging ik in Brugge toerisme studeren. Uiteindelijk werk ik al enkele jaren in een bank en verhuisde ik voor de liefde naar Antwerpen. Toch is de passie voor reizen en toerisme altijd gebleven.  

Met de aankoop begin 2020  van onze karaktervolle meesterwoning in Antwerpen, zag ik de kans om de draad van toerisme terug op te nemen. Enkele maanden later bieden we met “Upstairs” onze gerenoveerde gastenkamers Camille en Liselle aan om u te ontvangen. 

De authentieke elementen hebben we zoveel mogelijk proberen te bewaren, gecombineerd met een eigentijdse toets. Tegelijk bieden we u graag alle modern comfort van nieuwe privé badkamers met een inloopdouche, lavabo en toilet; Nespresso-apparaat; föhn,...

Voor de gordijnen, stoffering, bed- & badlinnen kozen we voor lokale bedrijven en Belgische kwaliteit. Het is heerlijk om na een dagje Antwerpen in slaap te vallen onder die witte percal katoenen lakens..."

Today, we have over 6,000 hand-picked villas, chateaux and holiday homes across the top holiday destinations – with new regions launching every year.

Or you are looking for an action-packed trip? Whatever you decide, it’s a good idea to put your requirements at the forefront when discussing with our travel experts who are the best in the business and we have countless awards to match. Trust us, we'll find you the perfect villa holiday to surpass your expectations. 

And the best part? Once you book a villa holiday, the service doesn't stop there. Our Free Concierge Service means you'll be in good hands to arrange catering & fridge stocking, housekeeping, childcare, tours & activities and so much more, to make your stay truly extraordinary. "
